## Bio

I'm Kevin Wang!

I study data science at the University of Toronto. My goal is to do cool stuff with neural networks.<br>

I don't have any career goals. My only goal is to be able to understand and build on data science research papers, like [this one](https://github.com/isl-org/PhotorealismEnhancement/blob/main/paper/paper.pdf), to be able to participate in challenges like the ImageNet challenge and to be able to come up with my own research topics and investigate them, because I think AI is cool. 

If becoming a data scientist, and working in research will help me in this journey, I will work my hardest to become one.
