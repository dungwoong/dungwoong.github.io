## Bio

I'm Kevin Wang!

I'm in the Data Science Specialist program at the University of Toronto.

My goal is to help businesses and individuals like myself find solutions to seemingly complex problems. This causes my interests to be broad, from statistics to data structures and algorithms to deep learning. 

I enjoy the combination of project management/business skills and technical skills that data science problems often require.

In terms of research, I am quite interested in deep learning and have experience with CNNs and transformers.

My other interests are web development, as it allows me to showcase my findings, and business development topics such as strategy, communication and project management.

## Experience

## Projects

**Game AI using supervised imitation learning**

Trained a convolutional neural network to play the popular video game, Temple Run 2. The network imitates human behaviors to achieve high scores.
