## Bio

I'm Kevin Wang!

I study data science at the University of Toronto.

With my knowledge and expertise, my goal is to help businesses and individuals like myself find solutions to seemingly complex problems. This causes my interests to be broad, from statistics to data structures and algorithms to deep learning.

In terms of research, I am quite interested in deep learning and have some experience with CNNs and transformers.

Other interests I have are algorithmic trading/indicators, cybersecurity, and business development topics such as strategy, communication and project management.

Finally, I'm interested in productivity and personal growth. I want to find general guidelines for growth, that can tie together many techniques and tricks for boosting productivity.
