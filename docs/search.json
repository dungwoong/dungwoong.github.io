      "contents": "\r\nHi!\r\nI am a student at the University of Toronto. I’m in the Data Science Specialist Program.\r\nRecently, I gave a workshop on web scraping and APIs. You can look at my past projects in the projects page.\r\nMy massive GPA at U of T shows that I am both hardworking and understand the content of my courses. Some notable courses I’ve taken are CSC207(Intro to Software Design), CSC236(Intro to Theory of Computation) and STA257(Probability and Statistics I).\r\nI use many python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib, and am used to writing scripts that help me collect and process data.\r\nMy main skills are my knowledge of web infrastructures(as I’ve done many web-scraping projects), my familiarity with many Python libraries, my general knowledge of programming concepts and my ability to present information to a general audience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
