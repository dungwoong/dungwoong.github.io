      "contents": "\r\nHi!\r\nI am a student at the University of Toronto. I’m in the Data Science Specialist Program, and I like studying statistics.\r\nRecently, I gave a workshop on web scraping and APIs. You can look at my past projects in the projects page. Some notable courses I’ve taken are CSC148(Intro to programming) and STA130(Intro to stats). I also learned to use many python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib in my spare time, and am used to writing scripts that help me collect and process data.\r\nI believe that having fun is the first step to success. All of my projects are inspired by some of my personal problems, and I enjoy improving parts of my life using code.\r\nIn my spare time, I work on digital art, I go to the gym, and I watch anime.\r\n(this is supposed to show that I am a human outside of whatever I do in University, I’m trying to show that I actually mean what I say and I’m not just writing some stuff down to satisfy a recruiter or something like that)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
