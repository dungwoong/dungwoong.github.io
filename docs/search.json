You can read more about my basic background/experience on the home page!\r\nI am a digital artist, but I am also studying data science, so I am at a weird crossroads where I am working with art AI, while simultaneously making art myself.\r\n\r\nI believe there are many insights that can be gained from artists, in the field of image generation. Artists must approach the visual world with structure, in order to capture the most important elements on a canvas.\r\nI’ve found little research in this area, and my goal is to solidify my(possibly naive) ideas, continue gaining knowledge of deep learning, and hopefully produce some interesting results!\r\nCareer-wise, I am looking for experience with computer vision, and computer science research. I am only a third-year student(which I’ve realized is quite inexperienced in the field of deep learning), so I am looking for an opportunity to develop my existing skills and to learn good industry practices in my field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The project is still in progress.\r\nGame AI using supervised imitation learning\r\n\r\n\r\nTrained a convolutional neural network to play the popular infinite runner “Temple Run 2,” by Imangi Studios.\r\nExplored efficient network architectures, different methods of data collection and methods of combatting overfitting in order to produce a generalizable model that can generate impressive in-game scores.\r\nData is hand-collected, using a program created in python.\r\nA short writeup of methods and results can be found here\r\nPredicting video game outcomes with Random Forests\r\nCreated a classification model to predict match outcomes of the popular game, League of Legends, with ~82% accuracy.\r\nWeb scraped the popular aggregator site, LeagueOfGraphs.com, and collected data from the official Riot Games API.\r\nUsed python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib and sklearn to process and visualize the data, and to fit a model.\r\nUsed a Random Forest Classifier to create a model with 82% Accuracy.
