      "contents": "\r\nHi!\r\nI am a student at the University of Toronto. I’m in the Data Science Specialist Program.\r\nI have academic experience in computer science. I have education in SQL, data structures/algorithms, and software design principles.\r\nI also have a statistical educational background, and have knowledge of multivariate calculus, logical proofs, and theory of statistical practice.\r\nI have worked with machine learning models in Python and R as well.\r\nOutside of school, I work with computer vision, and am currently learning PyTorch, hoping to work in research in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
