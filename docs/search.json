I’m in the Data Science Specialist Program, and I like studying statistics.\r\nRecently, I gave a workshop on web scraping and APIs. You can look at my past projects in the projects page. Some notable courses I’ve taken are CSC148(Intro to programming) and STA130(Intro to stats). I also learned to use many python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib in my spare time, and am used to writing scripts that help me collect and process data.\r\nIn my spare time, I work on digital art. I like drawing dark settings, inspired by movies that I’ve watched in the past.\r\nHere’s an example:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
