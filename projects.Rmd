# House prices linear regression project
Predicting house prices in Ames, Iowa.<br>
This was a challenge on Kaggle that I did. I mostly followed the tutorials there.

# League of Legends Project
Used the Riot Games API to scrape data for League of Legends(Video Game) matches. Hopes to find insights.
