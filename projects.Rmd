# League of Legends Web Scraping Project(V2)
Created a classification model to predict match outcomes of the popular game, League of Legends, with ~82% accuracy.

Web scraped the popular site, LeagueOfGraphs.com, and collected data from the official Riot Games API.

Used python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib and sklearn to process and visualize the data, and to fit a model.

Used a Random Forest Classifier to create a model with 82% Accuracy. More details about exploratory data analysis, visualization and model creation can be found [here](https://github.com/dungwoong/league-scrapev2/blob/main/writeup/Riot%20Games%20Writeup.pdf)
