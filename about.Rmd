Hi!

I am a student at the University of Toronto.<br>
I'm in the Data Science Specialist Program, and I like studying statistics.

Recently, I gave a workshop on web scraping and APIs.
You can look at my past projects in the projects page.<br>
Some notable courses I've taken are CSC148(Intro to programming) and STA130(Intro to stats). 
I also learned to use many python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib in my spare time, and am used to writing scripts that help me collect and process data.

I believe that having fun is the first step to success. All of my projects are inspired by some of my personal problems, and I enjoy improving parts of my life using code.

In my spare time, I work on digital art, I go to the gym, and I watch anime.

(this is supposed to show that I am a human outside of whatever I do in University, I'm trying to show that I actually mean what I say and I'm not just writing some stuff down to satisfy a recruiter or something like that)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```
