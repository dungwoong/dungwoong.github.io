Hi!

I am a student at the University of Toronto.<br>
I'm in the Data Science Specialist Program.

My strengths are mostly conceptual/abstract topics such as programming, math, and statistics. I am great at learning and applying ideas. For example, at my internship, I'm using my data science skills to lead an analytics project using python.

In my spare time, I'm working with Convolutional and Recurrent neural networks, and trying to do small projects to learn new concepts. I hope to work on data science research in the future. More on that soon!

My other skills include web scraping, SQL, data analysis/models in python.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```
