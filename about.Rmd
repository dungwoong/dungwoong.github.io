Hi!

I am a student at the University of Toronto.<br>
I'm in the Data Science Specialist Program.

I have academic experience in computer science. I have education in SQL, data structures/algorithms, and software design principles.

I also have a statistical educational background, and have knowledge of multivariate calculus, logical proofs, and theory of statistical practice.

I have worked with machine learning models in Python and R as well.

Outside of school, I work with computer vision, and am currently learning PyTorch, hoping to work in research in the future.
