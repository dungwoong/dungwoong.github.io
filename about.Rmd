  Kevin is a cool guy

Kevin is a student at the Univerisity of Toronto.<br>
He hopes to get into the Data Science program but perhaps his grades are too low.<br>

His most notable achievement in life is probably ~~getting an 80 in ENV200~~.

He occasionally programs and hopes to have a job one day.
